class can used in two ways 
1. class can be derived (inheritance) - IsA
2. object of the class can be used - hasA


Say we have a class Rectangle and from that we make a class called Cuboid which inherits Rectangle publicly. So, here we can say that since Cuboid inherits 
rectangle so Cuboid can be considered as modified Rectangle only. So, when we inherit a class we will say that Cuboid is a (isA) Rectangle.

See another example, say there is separate class Table Rectangle top as an object among other functions. Here we say that as Table class uses object of 
Rectangle named top we consider it as Table has a Rectangle. So, when we use a class by creating an object of that class then we will say that Table has 
a (hasA) Rectangle.

Classes can have data members of 3 kinds (i) Public (ii) Private (iii) Protected
