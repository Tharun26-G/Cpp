p++ - move pointer to next element
•p - - move pointer to previous element
•p+k  gives address of kth element form pointer location to right
•p-k  gives address of kth element from pointer location to left
•q-p  gives number of elements between 2 pointers p and q


why pointer? 
1.Programs can only access heap with the help of pointers
2.File in the disk can be accessed through the pointer

Heap Memory Allocation 
- dynamically 

main()
{
int A[5]={1,2,3,4,5};  //stack 
int *p;   //heap
p=new int [5];  //heap 
}

stack memory will delete after the scope 
Heap memory will stay still the program running ends 
      * must be dellocated
