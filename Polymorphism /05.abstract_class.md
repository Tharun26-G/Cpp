# Abstract class

If a class has pure virtual function then that class is known as abstract class.
Abstract class don't have the object but it can use pointers 

1. Purpose of inheritance is reusability. Above derived class gets fun1 from base class.
2. Polymorphism : We make a pure virtual function fun2 and derived class overrides that function fun2.

So, there are 3 types of classes in C++ :
1. A Base class having all concrete function no pure virtual function is implemented for reusability for child classes.
2. A Base class with all pure virtual function meant only for overriding i.e. polymorphism and such a base class is interface.
3. Base Class with some concrete functions and some virtual functions then purpose is reusability and polymorphism.

#2 and #3 known as abstract class too.
#2 interface
