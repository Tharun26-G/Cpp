## Type of Files: Text and Binary

- Text files are human readable and binary files are machine readable, what this means is if you write 23 in binary file it will be written in binary 0s and 1s form whereas in txt file 2 of 23 gets converted to ASCII code and 3 to its respective ASCII code i.e. 50 for 2 in ASCII and 51 for 3 in ASCII. For TXT notepad or any other text editor will convert every 8 bit of binary to ASCII code and look it up and convert to corresponding character. 

- To read and write data in binary in C++ `ios::binary` mode has to be used. Binary form is faster as for txt files conversion is required. Space wise as well txt takes up more space as compared to binary files.

- Binary is fast and takes less space
