## Streams

- Stream is a flow of data or flow of characters, streams are used for accessing the data from outside the program. From external sources or destination. We can have data from external source to program or vice-versa.

- Program can get data from keyboard, send data to monitor, read and write data to a file or from a network. There are various sources for program to receive and send data. There are Input Output streams called I/O. There are built-in classes present in C++ to access I/O streams that we can make use of. 

- Name of class is **ios** i.e. input output stream. From this we have `istream` class for input stream and `ostream` class for output stream. For **accessing files** there are classes available called `ifstream` input file stream and `ofstream` output file stream.

- For input stream from the keyboard, there is already an object present in iostream header file called `cin` and cout object of ostream class used to output to a device your data.
