```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Demo
{
    int *p;

public:
    Demo()
    {
        p = new int[10];
        cout << "Constructor of Demo" << endl;
    }
    ~Demo()
    {
        delete[] p; // To prevent deleting of class but memory of array not deleted from heap. Specify all resources to remove here.
        cout << "Destructor of Demo" << endl;
    }
};

void func()
{
    // Demo d; // Constructor and Destructor both are called.
    Demo *p = new Demo(); // Only constructor is called, when we create an object dynamically in the heap.
    delete p;             // When dealing with dynamic objects via pointers delete them by doing `delete p`
}

int main()
{
    func();
}
- When object gets deleted first Destructor of Derived will be called and after that only Destructor of Base will be called. Constructors are called from top to bottom or descending order and destructors are called from bottom to top or smallest class towards the derived class i.e. ascending order.
```
## Problem with Destructors:

- Say in main class you have a pointer, p to **Base** class but using that pointer we make object of **Derived** class in foll. manner.

```cpp
main()
{
    Base *p;
    p = new Derived();
    ...
    ...
    ...
    delete P; // Deletes derived class object.
}
```

- Destructor of derived and after that destructor of base class should be called, but here we have a pointer of Base class and the object of Derived class, so destructor of only Derived class will be called. But Base class destructor should also be called.

- When we have Base class pointer and we make Derived class object to call the Base class destructor we write virtual in front of Base class destructor `~Base()`, this is the reason we have virtual destructors.

- So, in inheritance if we want base class destructors to also be executed when derived class destructors are called we make it virtual.
