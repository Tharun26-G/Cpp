## Destructors

- We have already looked at constructors here we understand destructors with the help of following class called `Test`

```cpp
class Test
{
    public:
        Test()
        {
            cout << "Test created";
        }
        ~Test()
        {
            cout << "Test destroyed";
        }
}

main()
{
    Test *p = new Test(); // Constructor is called

    delete P; // Destructor is called.
}
```

- `~Test()`  is the destructor. Destructor is called when object is destroyed. Constructor is used for initialization purpose and is used to allocate resources. So, makes sense to come to conclusion that destructor is used **for deallocating resources**. External resources such as heap memory,file, network connection. Everything class acquires in constructor, class should release that in destructor.

- **Some Rules:** 
- Can we overload a constructor ? **Yes**
- Can we have multiple destructors? **No**
- Can a constructor return anything ? **No**
- Can a destructor return anything ? **No**
